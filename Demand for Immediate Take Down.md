# Demand for Immediate Take Down

Dear Sir or Madam:
 
We represent National Music Publishers' Association, Inc. (the “Publisher”), one of the largest and most successful music production companies in the world.  
 
It has come to our attention that you own or operate one or more websites devoted to selling illegal digital copies of the Publishers’ and others’ copyrighted works, including the websites located at XXX (the “Infringing Sites”).  Your actions constitute flagrant and extensive copyright infringement in violation of the copyright laws of both the United States and abroad.  Under 17 U.S.C. § 504, you may be held liable for statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work for willful infringement.  Continuing to engage in copyright infringement after receiving this express notice constitutes evidence of willful infringement.

We demand that you immediately and permanently stop any further unlawful reproduction or distribution of the Publishers’ copyrighted works, including through the Infringing Sites.  Failure to do so constitutes additional evidence of willful infringement, and the Publishers will not hesitate to pursue all legal remedies available to them. 

If you have questions, I can be reached at ehud@bramsonlaw.com or via phone at +1 (845) 600-7594.  This message is written without waiver of or prejudice to the Publishers’ rights, all of which are expressly reserved.

Sincerely,
